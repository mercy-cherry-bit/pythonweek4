# File Read & Write Challenge + Error Handling Lab

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project is part of the *File Handling & Error Handling* module.  
It demonstrates how to:
- Read a file in Python
- Modify its contents
- Write the modified version to a new file
- Handle errors gracefully if the file does not exist or cannot be read

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this repository
- file_read_write.py â†’ Main Python program
- README.md â†’ Project documentation

## ðŸš€ How it works
1. The program asks the user for a filename (e.g., example.txt).
2. It reads the content of the file.
3. It applies a modification (in this case, converts text to *uppercase*).
4. It writes the modified content into a new file called *modified_<filename>*.
5. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, an *error message* is shown instead of crashing.

## âš¡ Example
Input file: example.txt
